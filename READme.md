- GitHub User Search Application

This web application utilizes the GitHub API to display limited user data and provides functionality for searching and filtering users based on their usernames.

## Key Features

1. **Display GitHub Users**: The application fetches user data from the GitHub API using the fetch method. This data includes information such as user avatar, username, and profile URL.

2. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific GitHub users by their usernames. The application provides a search input field where users can type the username they want to search for.

3. **Filter Users by Keyword**: In addition to searching by username, the application also allows users to filter users based on keywords. This functionality enables users to narrow down the list of displayed users based on specific criteria or interests.

4. **HTML, CSS, and TypeScript**: The project utilizes HTML for structuring the web page, CSS for styling the user interface, and TypeScript for adding type safety and additional functionality to JavaScript code.

5. **TypeScript Extensions**: TypeScript extensions enhance the development experience by providing additional features and tools specific to TypeScript, such as type checking, code refactoring, and IntelliSense support.
